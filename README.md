## What's New

- **Built-in Web UI**: Edit config, add AI backends, and monitor live logs from your browser — starts automatically with the monitor. See [Web UI documentation](docs/webui.md).
- **Anthropic/Claude AI Backend**: Use Claude models (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) to evaluate listings alongside OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Ollama. See [AI Services](docs/README.md#ai-services) for configuration.
- **Configurable Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting framework for all notification types with per-instance and global limits. Telegram notifications use optimized defaults automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **⚠️ Legal Notice**: Facebook's EULA prohibits automated data collection without authorization. This tool was developed for personal, hobbyist use only. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with platform terms and applicable laws.

### Installation

> **Requires Python 3.10 or higher.** Check your version with `python --version`. If your system default is older, use `pip3.10` (or `pip3.11`, `pip3.12`, etc.) instead of `pip`, or create a virtual environment with the correct version.

```bash
pip install ai-marketplace-monitor
playwright install
```

### Basic Configuration

Create `~/.ai-marketplace-monitor/config.toml`:

```toml
[marketplace.facebook]
search_city = 'houston'  # Replace with your city

[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero 11'
min_price = 100
max_price = 300

[user.me]
pushbullet_token = 'your_token_here'  # Get from pushbullet.com

[monitor]
cdp_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:9222'  # Required in strict CDP mode
```

### Run the Monitor

```bash
ai-marketplace-monitor
```

The program will open a browser, search Facebook Marketplace, and notify you of matching items. A web UI also starts automatically at [http://127.0.0.1:8467](http://127.0.0.1:8467) for editing config and monitoring logs — see [Web UI Guide](docs/webui.md).

## 💡 Example Usage

**Find GoPro cameras under $300:**

```toml
[item.gopro]
search_phrases = 'Go Pro Hero'
keywords = "('Go Pro' OR gopro) AND (11 OR 12 OR 13)"
min_price = 100
max_price = 300
```

**Search nationwide with shipping:**

```toml
[item.rare_item]
search_phrases = 'vintage collectible'
search_region = 'usa'
delivery_method = 'shipping'
seller_locations = []
```

**AI-powered filtering:**

```toml
[ai.openai]
api_key = 'your_openai_key'

[item.camera]
description = '''High-quality DSLR camera in good condition.
Exclude listings with water damage or missing parts.'''
rating = 4  # Only notify for 4+ star AI ratings
```
